<h1>La Fitness Gym</h1>
<p>I have worked out since I was 15 years old. It all started as something I did
to condition for sports. I did not really enjoy going to the gym for the first couple
months. But once I did it for long enough, it kind of just became a part of my routine. 
I have been weight-lifting ever since and I don't ever plan to stop!</p>
