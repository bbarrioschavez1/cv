<h1>Schooling History</h1>
<h2>Before College</h2>
<p>Ever since I was a little kid, I have always attended schools in Marion County.
From kindergarten to 5th grade, I went to Lakeside Elementary school. From there, I went to Stonybrook Middle School
for a year. This was around the time when the school district mapping changed for whatever reason
and the next year I got sent to Creston Middle School. At the time, I didn't want to leave all
of my friends. But a few of my friends also got moved to Creston, and I made many new friends.
Once middle school was over, I attended Warren Central High School for all four years.</p>
<h2>IUPUI</h2>
<p>Right after high school, I jumped right into college, at <a href = "https://www.iupui.edu/" target="_blank">IUPUI</a> like everybody recommends you do. Still being
a kid, I decided to listen to everybody because I didn't know any better. My major was Fitness
Management and Personal Training. I am very big into fitness so I thought this would be a good career. 
I soon realized that my passion for exercising did not translate over very well into my studies. After one long
semester, I got an opportunity to work with an electrical company so I dropped out of IUPUI and started working
full-time. 
</p>
<h2>Ivy Tech</h2>
<p>After 2 years of working full-time, I decided it was time to go back to school and get a degree.
Coming into <a href = "https://www.ivytech.edu" target="_blank">Ivy Tech</a>, I was going for an AAS in Electrical Engineering. 
I had picked this major because I thought
electricity was interesting. I soon found out that I was not as interested in math as I used to be in high 
school. So then I swtiched my major to Information Technology Support. I found this major to be very boring. 
Luckily, IT Support helped me find the Introduction to Software Development Class. While taking SDEV 140, I
knew that this was the major I needed to pursue because it included everything I wanted in a major. That was 
when I discovered Website Development.
