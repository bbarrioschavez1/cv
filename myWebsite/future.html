<h2>What are my plans?</h2>
<p>As of right now, I have one more semester after this one until I can graduate with my AAS in Software Development 
degree. I was never quite sure how I would use my degree but I just knew that this was the field I wanted to 
be in. Luckily, I discovered Website Development this semester. I have really enjoyed this class.
<h2>Before college ends</h2>
<p>While I am in school, I plan on getting as much experience in Website Development as possible.
I just began working with CodeBlackIndy. It is an organization that reaches those students
who might not have had the opportunity to learn much in the technology field. I will be teaching HTML, CSS,
and JavaScript at a beginner's level. I am also applying for an internship at <a href = "https://www.life.church" target="_blank">Life Church</a>
so I can learn how to implement Website Development into a church.
<h2>Dream job</h2>
<p>Ideally, I would like to be a Wesbite Developer at a Christian church. This is something
I just realized and I hope that it becomes a reality. I am looking forward to see what
I can acheive with Website Development!
