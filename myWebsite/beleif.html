<h2>Where it started</h2>
<p>Growing up, I was raised a Catholic because that what my whole family was.
I would only go to church because I felt like that was something that I had to do.
Also, because my mom made me go to church. I have always believed that God existed and 
I still do. But I never felt "good" about being Catholic.</p>
<h2>The journey</h2>
<p>Once I was older, I was able to have my own opinion and voice in the matter. 
Finally, I mentioned something to my mom about it, and she felt the same way.
So that is when we began to search for a new church. We didn't know exactly what 
we were searching for but just hoped that we would find it. This process lasted for
a few months to a year. Towards the end, we began to give up on our search. So we took 
a break. 
</p>
<h2>Hope</h2>
<p>One day, my brother, Mario, mentioned to us that one of his friends had invited him to a church.
Mario and my other brother, Anthony, attended a church called The Caring Place for the first time by themselves.
Once they returned, they said that they liked it, but it had a very different feel than what we were used to. 
My mom and I were kind of nervous to attend because we weren't sure what to expect. The next weekend, we went and
really enjoyed the sermon. 
</p>
<h2>Our new home</h2>
<p>Fast forward to present day, my family and I still attend the Caring Place every Sunday
and we have seen our faith grow tremendously at this church, that we now call home.</p>
